  "precautions_we_need_to_take": ["Avoid known triggers (e.g., soaps, detergents, fragrances, certain fabrics, stress, sweat). Moisturize skin regularly with fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotions. Avoid scratching.  Keep fingernails short.  Shower in lukewarm water, not hot.  Use gentle, fragrance-free cleansers."],
